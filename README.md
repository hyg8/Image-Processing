# Image-Processing
Image processing This work consists of implementing and testing three image processing methods, this process is possible through the use of libraries which facilitate the implementation while testing different methods namely thresholding, edge detection, erosion and expansion. These techniques have processed the images in different ways as the purpose of image processing is to study the images, to transform them from the given information. As programming language we used python which is an interpreted programming language, multi-paradigm and multiplatform. It promotes structured, functional and object-oriented imperative programming, its use is effective in image processing. As libraries we used: Open CV (Open Source Computer Vision Library) is an open source computer vision and machine learning software library. Open CV was designed to provide a common infrastructure for computer vision applications and to accelerate the use of machine perception in commercial products. Numpy: is an extension of the Python programming language, intended to handle multidimensional matrices or arrays as well as mathematical functions operating on these arrays. Matploblib: is a library of the Python programming language intended to plot and visualize data in the form of graphs.
